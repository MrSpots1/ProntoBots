ok ideas of things to add:

idea:
!scramble
gives a scambled word
first person to write the word unscrambled gets a cookie

thinkings:
i need a random sentence generater....
and i need a new command to reveal the answer, like !unscramble
and i need a new command to guess the answer, like !guess
ooh i need to rework !guess so its !guess number ___ or !guess scramble ____ ___ ____ ___


idea:
!shift N ___ ___ ___ ___
does a ceaser cipher shift for N places of the remaining text

thinkings:
ok ceaser shift, not that hard....
ooh but also i could have a command, !codebreak ___ ___ ___
    - automatically tries to solve the cipher like for c++

idea:
!wordle
plays wordle

thinkings:
!wordle start
    -starts a game
!wordle end
    -cancels a game (can be used only by chat owners), ends the game
!wordle
    -pastes the current wordle progress
